# scroll
Example of vanilla JavaScript for scrolling.

A few years ago, when I was focused upon pure vanilla JavaScript, I wrote some code for scrolling.

The idea was to always scroll an exact amount either up or down.

It was a time before Vue and when I preferred vanilla JavaScript over emerging frameworks.

Rest assured, I would never do-it (again), that way.

Looking back, I can see that with Vue I could have accomplished the same result, much more quickly.

I populated the html with JavaScript with createElement.

Then make two buttons.

Then,two scroll functions.

Then, program control.

My thinking at the time was a desire to populate HTML at a much faster rate than React.

I was just coming out of WordPress designs that were incredibly slow, and at the time I was not very impressed with the speed of load with React.

I was on a quest for speed and feed, and I could deliver-it with vanilla JavaScript.

Now, in the 2020s, I can keep my quest for speed with the designs in Vue.

I also like the idea of Svelte and will be exploring that framework for the front-end.

Thanks,
